***Discord updated all class names in January 2022, which caused most older themes to stop working. This fork of [rmkx's themes](https://github.com/rmkx/rmkx.github.io) updates the themes with the new Discord classes.***

## Changes
- Class names updated for January 2022.
- Images rehosted on GitHub.
- Readme files edited for clarity.

1. Open [latest release](https://github.com/Saltssaumure/rmkx-theme-fix/releases/latest) page.
